When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You want to use a remote repository when you want to share code with other people.  It is very helpful for colabaration

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I like to pull the changes manually so that I can have control and nothing unexpected happens.  I can also fix any problems or bugs before it is launched.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    All of them involve copying in repositries.  With branches all the commits are sent to the same part of the repository.  With forking and cloning they both copy a whole repository.  Forking is made to use git hub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It is helpful if you are going to go offline and work so that you can merge your files after.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You could colabertate on a platform like drop box or in a shared folder that both people can update.
    It would be hard to code on a program like docs because I don't believe there is a way to code on there.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    You would want to makes changes in a large group because everything is able to stay a lot more organized.  If you are by yourself or with few people on the other hand, master may be easier to use.
